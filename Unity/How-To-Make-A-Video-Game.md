# How to make a video game

How are games made?

- Game designers
- Game artists
- Game developers

These roles can be between one or thousands of people.

Game artists deal with what you see and hear in the game.

### What is a game engine?

Game engines help deal with things like the physics and rendering graphics.

A game engine is a framework for building games that helps coordinate things like assets and gives you all the tools you need to start coding.

A game engine is not a 3D art engine.

We are Unity as it is easier to learn when you are just getting started.

## Part 2

### Unity Interface

Create a `_Scenes` folder.

Game assets are `a piece of media for the game`. This could be sounds, scripts or models etc.

#### Prefabs

Stores several objects together. An example `prefab` is the frog which contains the 3d model, the texture and the animation together.

### Setup the project

Games use `real time rendering` where it is drawn at the frame rate. Generally you want to aim for 60fps or higher. This will make is look as smooth as possible.
