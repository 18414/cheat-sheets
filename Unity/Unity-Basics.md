# Unity Basics

The initial `default layout` is the initial arrangement. You can change the layout on the top right.

### Overview

The hierarchy is on the left side of the screen. It's the list of objects in the scene.

The bottom part is full of the assets.

The main screen has the `scene` and `game` views that allow you to see different perspectives.

There are also a number of different preset values that you can use as well.

You can also use the tab and drag to rearrange the view.
