## Virtual Devices 

Genymotion is useful to grab a bunch of different emulators for Android and come with a personal use or paid license. 

The device version and Genymotion may need to be aligned, so to do so, create a new Virtual Device.

This can be easily done by selecting `Create`, choosing a device and then naming it to something useable like `reactnative`.

## Testing the app on the emulator

To do so, first run the emulator. After the emulator is up and running, use `react-native run-android` on the CLI to start the app. The CLI will respond if there are any errors.

## Uploading to the Google Play Store
