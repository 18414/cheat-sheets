## Adding the certificate

Head to the iOS dev portal and add the appropriate certificate.

You may need to open Keychain access to generate a new key using `Keychain Access > Certificate Assistant > Req Cert from Cert Auth` and generate a new cert. This cert will be used to generate what you need to import into Keychain Access from the dev portal.

Once created, download the certificate
