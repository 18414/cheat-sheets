# Data Structures with Python

## PYDS-12.0: Arrays

- Introduction to Arrays
- Low Level Arrays
- Dynamic Arrays and Amotization
- Array based "mini project"
- Several Array Interview Problems

**Array Sequences**
- List
- Tuple
- String

All of which support indexing.

## PYDS-12.1: Low Level Arrays

- Focus on low level computer theory

**Low-level comp architecture**
- Memory stored in bits, stored in units called bytes
- Stores these bytes in an address
- Just as easy to retrieve or stored in O(1) time
- Arrays can be a contiguous portion of the computers memory
	- eg. String is consecutive
	- each location within the array is a *cell*
	- calcs done by start address + (cellsize * index)
