## Introduction to Microservices

Microservices helps the method for "always on" apps.

Distributed systems will be taught to add ontop of tools we may already use like Chef etc.

Order:

1. Understanding the basics
2. How to package and distribute apps
3. Running applications using a distributed platform that can scale

### The Evolution of Applications

Why was it designed this way?

Years ago, applications were huge and it would take hours just for a build. Typically you would release software infrequently.

Recently, the idea of microservices is to break down these large applications which allow for faster deployments.

The main reason for microservices is to speed up development. Breaking things down into microservices allow you have many releases or few releases.

If we think of a simple setup being done through things like Chef. Co-ordination of many things will need to compose them all together like a Docker compose or a kubernetes setup.

### Microservices

What does it mean? It's just an architectual approach. It's goes for:
- Modularity
- Scalability
- Ease of deployment

The design pattern applies to any application. It just refers to rapid deployments and continuous delivery. it pushes the automation tools to their limits.
