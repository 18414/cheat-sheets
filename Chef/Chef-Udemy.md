## Configuration Management

Maintaining consistency for server integrity.

The process of configuration can be automated by some extent. When you reach scale, this automation is at the heart of configuration management (IT orchetration).

Imagine we are deploying a web server. If we have a config management solution, this could take minutes instead of hours.

System auditing will also be a hassle for disaster recovery too.

Revision control systems can also be version controlled with `infrastructure as code` by having these environments scripted.

## Infrastructure as Code

Examples:

- version control
- testing

These all helps to validate infrastructure code.
