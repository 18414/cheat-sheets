## Processes and Threads 

Processes have two characteristics:

1. Resource Ownership 
	- process includes a virtual address space to hold the process image 
	- the OS performs a protection function to prevent unwanted interference between processes with respect to resources
2. Scheduling/Execution
	- follows an execution path that may be interleaved with other processes
