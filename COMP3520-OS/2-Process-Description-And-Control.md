# Process Description and Control

**Objectives**

- How are processes represented and controlled by the OS
- `Process states` which characterize the behaviour of processes 
- `Data structures` used to manage processes
- Ways in which the OS uses these data structures to control process execution

## Operating System 

Program that controls the execution of application programs.
- Interface between applications and hardware.
- Frequently relinquishes control and must depend on the processor to allow it to regain control â€“ events driven

## System Calls
- Typically high-level language (C or C++)
