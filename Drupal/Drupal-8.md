# Drupal 8

## Installation

Download Drupal: https://www.drupal.org/download

- Save the contents at the base of your new repo/directory i.e. so the url will be `localhost/YOUR_DIRECTORY/DRUPAL-CONTENT/`

Go to `localhost/YOUR_DIRECTORY/DRUPAL-CONTENT/` and follow the prompts
You also need to run `composer install` from your sites root directory.

## Basics of Content Creation

What we deal with out-of-the-box. Content entry being the most important.

Using `Content > Add content` to get a list of content that we can add.

If we create a page `About` and change the settings on the right hand side, we can also begin to add tables for quick access.

## Publishing Options - Published, Promoted, URL

If we create an article without the default settings, we can then use `saved as unpublished` from the save and publish dropdown. If content is not published, you'll be redirected to a login from a private browser and not allowed to use.
