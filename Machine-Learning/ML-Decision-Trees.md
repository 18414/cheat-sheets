# Decision Trees

## Intuition

CART: Classification and Regression Trees

We speak about both types, but for now - focus on regression trees.

Regression trees are a bit more complex than classification trees.

Imagine a scatter plot with two IV and we are predicting an DV y (which you wouldn't be able to see on the chart). Essentially the DV would sit on the z axis.

Once you run the regression decision tree algorithm, the scatter plot will be split up into segments.
