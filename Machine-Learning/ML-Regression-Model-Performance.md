# Regression Model Performance

## R-Squared Intuition

Interesting parameter and most people use it without understanding the underlying principles.

We spoke about the `simple linear regression` model being the result of the `ordinary least squares` method. This is also known as `sum of squares residuals` and is given as `SS[res]`.

If we instead took `SUM(y[i] - y[avg])^2`, we get the `total sum of squares SS[tot]`.
