# Angular 2 Basics

You can not just use Angular for web apps, but also iOS and Java using Native kit.

## Why Angular?

- it's Modular 
	- in previous versions, you needed the entire Angular framework loaded
- uses TypeScript, it uses static typing
- Google has hundreds of internal applications using Angular 
- large community of developers 

Angular JS refers to version 1, whereas Angular refers to version 2.

## The Parts and Pieces of an Angular Application

**How does it work?**

- App requires one `root` component
- The app requires services, components and 3rd party modules
	- Services can be internal or part of 3rd party modules

- `Services`: used to perform things like long running calcs or running web requests.
- `Components`: Broken down components/elements 
- `NgModule`: This is like a container for the application
	- `Ng` is the namespace Angular adopted
