# Vim

## Vim Packages and creating files

Installing Vim `yum install vim` of `apt-get install vim`.

`vim -g` can actually run the GUI - who cares though. There are a number of different GUI wrappers. `gvim` is the most popular.

So we have `vi`, `vim` - the improved vi and `gvim`.

## Vim modes

1. Command/Normal mode
2. Insert mode
