## Networking

### Networking Bottlenecks

Increase network performance = increase instance size.

EBS Throughput != network throughput. This is writing to disk as opposed to EC2 talking to each other within the same subnet.

### DNS 101

DNS is used to convert human friendly domains to an `Internet Protocol (IP)`.

IPv4 is a 32 bit field and has 42 billion addresses.

IPv6 has an address space of 128 bits. 340 undecillion addresses.

The big issue at the moment is that everyone is still using IPv4 - this is driven by ISPs.

Amazon previously did not have IPv6 support for backend systems. This changed around 2016.
