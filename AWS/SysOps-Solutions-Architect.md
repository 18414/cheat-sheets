## Networking

### Networking Bottlenecks

Increase network performance = increase instance size.

EBS Throughput != network throughput. This is writing to disk as opposed to EC2 talking to each other within the same subnet.

### DNS 101

DNS is used to convert human friendly domains to an `Internet Protocol (IP)`.

IPv4 is a 32 bit field and has 42 billion addresses.

IPv6 has an address space of 128 bits.
