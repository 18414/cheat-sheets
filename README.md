## RM-1: Styles for editing

1. Use H2 for Major headings with unique code. Lower headings for subsections if required.
2. Mark all major Sections with a Code and a numeral for the section.
3. Use `***` for line breaks between major sections
4. Use __<title>__ for subheadings that aren't worthy enough to require a heading tag to prevent Section increases in Dash.
5. For hints, have `***` above and below and put "hint" in bold italics.
